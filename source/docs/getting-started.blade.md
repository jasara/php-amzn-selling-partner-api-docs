# Getting Started

The PHP Selling Partner API Fluent SDK is a package to expose a fluent interface for interacting with the Amazon Selling Partner API. The goal is to simplify the API experience for a faster and easier development experience.

If you are using Laravel, we have also published a [Laravel-specific wrapper](#a) you can use in your project.

Please note that if you are using this SDK for commerical purposes, and your worldwide annual revenue is over $100,000, you must [purchase a license](https://github.com/jasara/php-amzn-selling-partner-api#license).
